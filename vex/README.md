# Welcome to the Intel Third-Party Vulnerability Exploitability Exchange (VEX) Repository 
This page is designed to serve as a preliminary model for an automated system that will facilitate the sharing of **VEX** disclosures related to third-party Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (**CVEs**) affecting Intel products.

But first, what exactly is a **VEX**? The Vulnerability Exploitability Exchange is a new industry framework that provides critical information on the exploitability of identified vulnerabilities within software and hardware products. It is a valuable resource for understanding the real-world applicability of a CVE in a given environment, detailing whether a product is genuinely at risk and if the vulnerability is practically exploitable. This knowledge is essential for prioritizing security measures and mitigating potential threats effectively.

On this page, you can expect to find periodic updates with VEX disclosures that offer insights into the security of Intel products in the context of third-party CVEs. These disclosures are part of our ongoing commitment to transparency and proactive security management, helping you stay informed and prepared.

Please note that the repository you see today is a prototype. It represents the first step towards a fully automated VEX disclosure system that we plan to unveil to the public in the future. This automated system will streamline the dissemination of VEX information, ensuring you have access to timely and accurate security assessments.

Thank you for your interest in Intel's security initiatives. _Keep an eye on this page for the latest updates and the eventual launch of our automated VEX disclosure system_.
